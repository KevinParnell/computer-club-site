    <h3>Step 7: Registration</h3>
    <p>Your Admissions Counselor will notify you about steps and dates to register for classes.</p>
    <h3>Step 8:	Transferable Credits</h3>
    <p>You may earn credit toward a Florida Poly degree through several credit-by-examination programs, under the following guidelines:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You must take the exams (AICE, AP, IB CLEP) and report your scores to the university before enrolling, or, at the latest, before the end of your first term.</li>
      <li>You may earn a maximum of 45 semester hours by combining AICE, AP, IB, and CLEP credits.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Equivalent courses earned by examination generally fulfill the same requirements that a Florida Polytechnic University course fulfills. Credit will only be awarded once for any subject.</p>
